Don\u2019t Shoot Portland again sought and obtained a court order to limit police\u2019s use of those weapons.", "Then on June 30, just four days after a federal judge had sided with protesters and issued a restraining order on the use by police of less-lethal weapons, Portland officers meeting protesters outside the local police union building again fired smoke grenades, rubber bullets, and other impact munitions into the crowd, injuring several people. They then declared the protest a riot and deployed tear gas despite the court order restricting its use.", "\u201cThey blatantly ignored the order,\u201d Tai Carpenter, Don\u2019t Shoot Portland\u2019s board president, told The Intercept. \u201cWhat happened on June 30 was just an all-out attack on civilians. That night just really stands out for the vast amount of violence that was being inflicted on the street.\u201d", "In August, as protests in Portland continued uninterrupted for a third month, Don\u2019t Shoot Portland filed a new motion, asking the federal judge in the case to hold the city in contempt of court over police use of \u201cless-lethal\u201d munitions that night. In a court hearing this week, protesters testified in graphic detail about what they described as an unprovoked, violent response to a protest that had been largely peaceful.", "A spokesperson for the city of Portland declined to comment on pending litigation. Attorneys for the city said in court that police response \u201cwas based on good faith and reasonable interpretations of the less-lethal order.\u201d They argued that police were responding to protesters throwing bottles, rocks, and cans and shining green lasers at them, and that officers feared that protesters would set the police union\u2019s building on fire. In court filings, they wrote that plaintiffs had offered \u201cvague descriptions of uses of force such that it is not possible to begin to evaluate whether the uses violate the Less Lethal Order.\u201d", "The implication that a confrontation between protesters and police was too chaotic to discern, and that police were justified in their outsize response by some individuals\u2019 actions toward them, is one that\u2019s been regularly invoked following violent repression of protests. Often the official narrative established by police is hard to challenge in a court setting, because evidence is usually messy or incomplete, or the chain of events gets obscured in the fog of war surrounding many protests.", "But the June 30 incidents were not only among the most violent in Portland\u2019s summer of protest, they were also some of the best documented, captured in several long videos shot from different angles by protesters and bystanders. \u201cIt was one of the most heavily visualized nights of the protests,\u201d said Carpenter. \u201cThere were a lot of livestreamers there, there were people on their balconies, because it was in a residential neighborhood.\u201d", "In fact, the number and quality of videos has allowed attorneys for Don\u2019t Shoot Portland, working with the applied-research group ", ", to produce an unusually detailed reconstruction of that night\u2019s events, a granular analysis of a number of incidents of police violence over a 90-minute period of time that clearly shows the circumstances, and lack of justification, that preceded each deployment of force. The reconstruction, which was shown in court, offered a forensic analysis of a protest with a level of detail that is usually reserved for criminal investigations. It provided a rare piece of evidence of abuse by officers that is much harder to dismiss than many witness accounts of police violence, opening the door for an equally rare moment of accountability.", "\u201cWhat these protests have exposed is the utter contempt that the police bureau has for criticism or even the idea that anybody should question what they do at any time,\u201d Jesse Merrithew, one of the attorneys representing Don\u2019t Shoot Portland, told The Intercept.", "\u201cYou can watch it on video what actually happened,\u201d he added.\u201cWhat we\u2019re hopeful of is that this helps the court impose the accountability that the city has been unwilling or unable to impose on the police bureau.\u201d", "On the evening of June 30, protesters who had previously stayed mostly downtown for the first time moved to the more suburban area where the Portland Police Association has its headquarters. By then, a growing number of people in Portland had begun to protest not only to demand justice for Floyd, but also large cuts to the police bureau\u2019s budget and accountability for violence carried out by local police. In court documents, Don\u2019t Shoot Portland called the police union ", "the chief obstacle to police accountability in this city.\u201d", "Protesters met a line of officers before reaching the union\u2019s building and stopped at a distance, chanting or listening to speakers. Witnesses described seeing a couple plastic bottles hurled toward the officers, but no further criminal conduct and \u201cnothing shocking or riotous.\u201d But within minutes of protesters\u2019 arrival, officers in full riot gear filled the street. Using a loudspeaker on an LRAD truck, a type of sonic weapon sometimes\u00a0deployed at protests, they announced that the assembly had been declared unlawful and threatened to deploy force to arrest protesters. Then, as the crowd complied with orders to move back, police, unprovoked, begun pushing and beating people back with batons. Almost immediately, and responding to no visible provocation, they fired the first impact munitions and pepper-sprayed people at close range.", "The reconstruction of the following hour and a half that was presented in court zeroed in on four moments that evening during which police deployed multiple types of less-lethal weapons, as well as a moment when they \u201cbull-rushed\u201d into the crowd. It ends showing police as they declared a riot and deployed tear gas.", "In the first incident, police can be seen shoving and beating people with batons and pepper-spraying them in the face, before shooting munitions at them at close range, even as protesters are moving back as directed. Police are also shown grabbing a protester holding a banner, ripping it, and preventing people from dispersing despite ordering them to do so. In the second incident, a protester can be seen throwing a bottle on the ground in front of police \u2014 in response to which police fire impact munitions at the protester multiple times before rolling a smoke grenade into the receding crowd. Officers are then seen firing at a different protester who kicked away a smoke canister. In the third incident, police are seen shooting impact munitions at a crowd that was posing no threat, from 120 feet away, and then doing so again at a closer distance during a fourth incident.", "In court, James Comstock, a lead investigator in the case, walked a judge through SITU\u2019s reconstruction, which he explained was built using a laser scan of the area to reproduce a three-dimensional model of the street where the protest took place. Visual evidence of each incident was then mapped onto the model and replayed in real time. Each incident was presented from multiple viewpoints, including side views and aerial views captured by a bystander filming from his balcony. And each deployment of force was shown in the context of the 30 seconds that preceded it, in order to paint as accurate a picture as possible of any action that might have justified it.", "\u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody has used a reconstruction like this in a protest case,\u201d Merrithew told The Intercept. \u201cWe use them all the time in criminal cases and we\u2019ve used similar reconstructions for police shooting cases.\u201d", "\u201cIt gives a really good overview for people to understand what\u2019s going on, the movement of the police and the protesters, and the violence, and it\u2019s in real-time so you can actually see what\u2019s happening,\u201d echoed Carpenter. \u201cIt will show a lot of people what we\u2019ve been saying, that it was all unprovoked.\u201d", "In court, the judge also heard firsthand accounts from protest participants, including Pedro Anglada Cordero, the protester who was shot with a rubber bullet after kicking a smoke canister away, and Eric Greatwood, a livestreamer and a regular presence at Portland protests who recorded most of the evening with a video action camera placed on top of a 20-foot pole, and who was shot in the groin with a FN303 round, a type of impact munition that has caused ", "\u00a0in the past.", "Anglada Cordero, who was at the protest with his wife, was retreating from police along with most others in the crowd when a smoke canister was tossed toward him. Anglada Cordero, who noted that his wife had already been coughing because of the chemical agents in the air, said that he instinctively moved to kick the can away. When the can barely moved, he took a few more steps and kicked it further away, the video shows. Police immediately shot him with rubber bullets, hitting him once behind the knee and once in the thigh, and leaving tennis ball-sized bruises later documented in court filings.", "\u201cMy first, spontaneous reaction was to get it away from us,\u201d he told The Intercept, referring to the canister. \u201cIt was in my interest to keep our immediate group safe from being exposed to more agents.\u201d", "But police took the gesture as an attack on them, and right after he kicked the canister, things escalated quickly, Anglada Cordero said. Moments later someone who tried to grab and toss a can was tackled to the ground. In court, city attorneys sought to describe the incidents as evidence of protesters\u2019 violent conduct. Anglada Cordero said he was just trying to protect his wife, himself, and those in his immediate vicinity.", "\u201cThe moment they toss a smoke canister our way and the moment someone kicks it back, that constitutes a reason for them to escalate and retaliate,\u201d he told The Intercept. \u201cSo suddenly they are in the right to use ammunition against the crowd, but the crowd has no right to defend themselves.\u201d", "Eric Greatwood, an independent livestreamer who has filmed dozens of protests, captured much of the evening on video, providing footage that was used for the reconstruction presented in court. At one point, officers recognized him and called him by name, ordering him to move back. \u201cThat just sent the hairs of my arm up, just to call me by my name like that,\u201d Greatwood told The Intercept. He complied but kept filming from the sidelines as police arrested protesters. Then moments later, as Greatwood crouched down to look at an unexploded smoke grenade, police fired an impact munition at him, hitting him in the groin.", "\u201cI know for a fact that they did it intentionally because there have been other people who have been fired on in that area,\u201d said Greatwood, who can be heard moaning in the video as his camera kept rolling. \u201cThey have sights on those things, they know exactly how to fire them, they are supposed to bounce them off the ground. They fired directly at me.\u201d", "A U.S. Air Force veteran, Greatwood said that anyone in the military caught doing what police did to him would be in prison. \u201cI don\u2019t know how a man can actually hit another man in the groin, that just completely baffles me, he totally aimed for it.\u201d The officer who shot him, Brent Taylor, said in court that had had not intended to target Greatwood\u2019s groin. \u201cI\u2019m shooting at a moving target,\u201d he testified. \u201cI\u2019m aiming at his lower legs but how quickly he changes his position, I cannot control.\u201d", "Greatwood, who has filed notice of his intent to sue the city for using excessive force, said that he was in pain for weeks after being shot and had difficulty using the bathroom.

But he felt he had been targeted that night because he was there with a camera. \u201cThey are probably upset because they know that they have been acting out of line, and they don\u2019t like it being broadcast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are doing things that are proper, you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of a camera and the truth.\u201d", "That night, he said, he had seen \u201cbarely anything happening\u201d before police unleashed on protesters. \u201cI saw more things that seemed blown out of proportion when it came to the police providing footage or photos to the press,\u201d he added. \u201cI felt like there was a lot of gaslighting from the police, and that there was not a whole lot that the protesters were doing to get them egged on.\u201d", "Others who testified last week also said that regardless of the outcome in court, it was important for Portland residents to document and address the harm and trauma inflicted on countless protesters over the last months. \u201cThere are so many people that have gone through something so similar to what I went through that night,\u201d said Anglada Cordero, who after being shot helped other protesters who were maced at close range and couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cWhen you go through such an experience, and you see others hurt, then you feel compelled to come out and be in solidarity with others. And that\u2019s what happens every night, when people are getting hurt, more people come out and help each other.\u201d", "The judge in the case is expected to rule on whether to hold the city in contempt of court in the coming days.", "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to have faith in the court system when it\u2019s been proven all your life that your civil liberties don\u2019t matter,\u201d said Carpenter of Don\u2019t Shoot Portland. \u201cBut the trauma and the violence have been clearly documented on the record; they\u2019re facts that can\u2019t be ignored.

But in recent years, social media monitoring has ", " an important way to fill gang databases.", "As part of a broader effort to feed information about crime to police under the general rubric of public \u201cthreats,\u201d Dataminr staffers attempted to flag potential violent gang activity without the aid of any special algorithms or fancy software, sources said; instead they pored over thousands and thousands of tweets, posts, and pictures, looking for armed individuals who appeared to be affiliated with a gang. It\u2019s an approach that was neither an art nor a science and, according to experts in the field, is also a surefire way of putting vulnerable men and women of color under police scrutiny or worse.", "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t specific,\u201d said one Dataminr source with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s anti-gang work. \u201cAnything that could be tangentially described as a [gang-related] threat\u201d could get sucked into Dataminr\u2019s platform.", "With no formal training provided on how to identify or verify gang membership, Dataminr\u2019s army of \u201cDomain Experts\u201d were essentially left to use their best judgment, or to defer to ex-cops on staff. If Dataminr analysts came across, say, a tweet depicting a man with a gun and some text that appeared to be gang-related, that could be enough to put the posting in a police-bound stream as containing a \u201cpossible gang member,\u201d this source said, adding that there was little if any attempt to ever check whether such a weapon was legally possessed or obtained.", "In practice, Dataminr\u2019s anti-gang activity amounted to \u201cwhite people, tasked with interpreting language from communities that we were not familiar with\u201d coached by predominantly white former law enforcement officials who themselves \u201chad no experience from these communities where gangs might be prevalent,\u201d per a second source. \u201cThe only thing we were using to identify them was hashtags, possibly showing gang signs, and if there was any kind of weapon in the photo,\u201d according to the first source. There was \u201cno institutional definition of \u2018potential gang member,\u2019 it was open to interpretation.\u201d All that really mattered, these sources say, was finding as much danger as possible, real or perceived, and transmitting it to the police.", "In its written comments, Dataminr stated that \u201cFirst Alert does not identify indicators of violent gang association or identify whether an event is a crime.\u201d Asked whether the company acknowledges providing any gang-related alerts or comments to customers, McGee did not directly respond, saying only that \u201cthere is no alert topic for crime or gang-related events.\u201d Dataminr did not respond to a question about the race of former law enforcement personnel it employs.", "A Dataminr source said that there never appeared to be any minimum age on who was flagged as a potential gang affiliate: \u201cI can definitely recall kids of school-age nature, late middle school to high school\u201d being ingested into Dataminr\u2019s streams. Unlike Dataminr\u2019s work identifying emerging threats in Europe or the Middle East, the company\u2019s counter-gang violence monitoring felt slapdash by comparison, two Dataminr sources said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of latitude in determining [gang membership], it wasn\u2019t like other kind of content, it was far more nebulous,\u201d said the first source, who added that Dataminr staff were at times concerned that the pictures they were flagging as evidence of violent gang affiliation could be mere adolescent tough-guy posturing, completely out of context, or simply dated: \u201cWe had no idea how old they were,\u201d the source added. \u201cPeople save [and repost] photos. It was completely open to interpretation.\u201d", "While any image depicting a \u201cpossible gang member\u201d with a weapon would immediately be flagged and transmitted to the police, Dataminr employees, tasked with finding \u201cthreats\u201d nationwide, worried why some armed men were subject to software surveillance while others were not. \u201cThe majority of the focus stayed toward gangs that are historically black and Latino,\u201d said one source. \u201cMore effort was put into inner-city Chicago gangs than the Three Percenters or things related to Aryan Brotherhood,\u201d this source continued, adding that they recalled worried conversations with colleagues about why the company spent so much time finding online images of armed black and brown people \u2014 who may have owned or possessed such a weapon legally \u2014 but not white people with guns.", "Two Dataminr sources directly familiar with these operations told The Intercept that although the company\u2019s teams of Domain Experts were untrained and generally uninformed on the subject of American street gangs, the company employed ex-law enforcement agents as in-house \u201cgang experts\u201d to help scan social media.", "Although Dataminr has touted itself as an \u201cAI\u201d firm, two company sources told The Intercept this overstated matters, and that most of the actual monitoring at the company was done by humans scrolling, endlessly, through streams of tweets. \u201cThey kept saying \u2018the algorithm\u2019 was doing everything,\u201d said a Dataminr source, but \u201cit was actually mostly humans.\u201d But this large staff of human analysts was still expected to deliver the superhuman output of an actual product based on some sort of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d or sophisticated machine learning. Inadequate training combined with strong pressure to crank out content to meet internal quotas and impress police clientele dazzled by \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d presentations led to predictable problems, the two sources said. The company approach to crime fighting began to resemble \u201ccreating content in their heads that isn\u2019t there,\u201d said the second source, \u201cthinking Dataminr can predict the future.\u201d", "As Dataminr can\u2019t in fact predict crime before it occurs, these sources say that analysts often fell back on stereotyped assumptions, with the company going so far as providing specific guidance to seek crime in certain areas, with the apparent assumption that the areas were rife with criminality. Neighborhoods with large communities of color, for example, were often singled out for social media surveillance in order to drum up more threat fodder for police.", "\u201cIt was never targeted towards other areas in the city, it was poor, minority-populated areas,\u201d explained one source. \u201cMinneapolis was more focused on urban areas downtown, but weren\u2019t focusing on Paisley Park \u2014 always \u2018downtown areas,\u2019 areas with projects.\u201d", "The two sources told The Intercept that Dataminr had at times asked analysts to create information feeds specific to certain housing projects populated predominantly by people of color, seeming to contradict the company\u2019s 2016 claim that it does not provide any form of \u201cgeospatial analysis.\u201d \u201cAny sort of housing project, bad neighborhood, bad intersection, we would definitely put those in the streams,\u201d explained one source. \u201cAny sort of assumed place that was dangerous. It was up to the Domain Experts. It was just trial and error to see what [keywords] brought things up. Dataminr obviously didn\u2019t care about unconscious bias, they just wanted to get the crimes before anyone else.\u201d", "Two Dataminr sources familiar with the company\u2019s Twitter search methodology explained that although Dataminr isn\u2019t able to provide its clients with direct access to the locational coordinates sometimes included in tweet metadata, the company itself still uses location metadata embedded in tweets, and is able to provide workarounds when asked, offering de facto geospatial analysis. At times this was accomplished using a simple keyword search through the company\u2019s access to the Twitter \u201cfirehose,\u201d a data stream containing every public tweet from the moment it\u2019s published. Keyword-based trawling would immediately alert Dataminr anytime anyone tweeted publicly about a particular place. \u201cAny time that Malcolm X Boulevard was mentioned, we would be able to see it\u201d in a given city, explained one source by way of a hypothetical.", "Dataminr wrote in its statement to The Intercept that \u201cFirst Alert identifies breaking news events without any regard to the racial or ethnic composition of an area where a breaking news event occurs. \u2026 Race, ethnicity, or any other demographic characteristic of the people posting public social media posts about events is never part of determining whether a breaking news alert is sent to First Alert clients.\u201d It also said that \u201cFirst Alert does not enable any type of geospatial analysis. First Alert provides no feature or function that allows a user to analyze the locations of specific social media posts, social media users or plot social media posts on a map.\u201d", "Asked if Dataminr domain experts look for social media leads specific to certain geographic areas, McGee did not deny that they do, writing only, \u201cDataminr detects events across the entire world wherever they geographically occur.\u201d", "On other occasions, according to one source, Dataminr employed the use of a \u201cpseudo-predictive algorithm\u201d that scrapes a user\u2019s past tweets for clues about their location, though they emphasized this tool functioned with \u201cnot necessarily any degree of accuracy.\u201d This allows Dataminr to build, for example, bespoke in-house surveillance streams of potential \u201cthreats\u201d pegged to areas police wish to monitor (for instance, if a police department wanted more alerts about threatening tweets from or about Malcolm X Boulevard, or a public housing complex). These sources stressed that Dataminr would try to provide these customized \u201cthreat\u201d feeds whenever asked by police clients, even as staff worried it amounted to blatant racial profiling and the propagation of law enforcement biases about where crimes were likely to be committed.", "Dataminr told The Intercept in response that \u201cFirst Alert provides no custom solutions for any government organizations, and the same First Alert product is used by all government organizations. All First Alert customers have access to the same breaking news alerts.\u201d", "Even if public sector customers use the same version of the First Alert app, the company itself has indicated that the alerts provided to customers could be customized: Its 2019 presentation to the FBI includes a slide stating that clients can adjust \u201cuser-defined criteria\u201d like \u201ctopic selection\u201d and \u201cgeographic filters\u201d prior to \u201calert delivery.\u201d Shown the below slide from the presentation, Dataminr said it was consistent with its statement.", "The specially crafted searches focused on areas of interest to police were done \u201cmainly looking for criminal incidents in those areas,\u201d one source explained. When asked by police departments to find criminality on social media, \u201careas that were predominantly considered more white\u201d were routinely overlooked, while poorer neighborhoods of color were mined for crime content.", "Another source told The Intercept of an internal project they were placed on as part of a trial relationship with the city government of Chicago, for which they were instructed to scan Twitter for \u201cEntertainment news from the North Side, crime news from the South Side.\u201d (It is not clear if these instructions came from the city of Chicago; the Chicago Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.)", "This source explained that through its efforts to live up to the self-created image as an engine of bleeding-edge \u201cintelligence\u201d about breaking events, \u201cDataminr is in a lot of ways regurgitating whatever the Domain Experts believe people want to see or hear\u201d \u2014 those people in this case being the police.\u00a0This can foster a sort of feedback loop of racial prejudice:\u00a0stereotyped assumptions\u00a0of what sort of keyword searches and locales might yield evidence of criminality are then used to bolster the", "stereotyped assumptions\u00a0of American police. \u201cIn a way, Dataminr and law enforcement were perpetuating each other\u2019s biases,\u201d the source said, forming a sort of Twitter-based perpetual motion machine of racial confirmation bias: \u201cWe would make keyword-based streams [for police] with biased keywords, then law enforcement would tweet about the crimes, then we would pick up ", " tweets.\u201d", "Experts on criminal justice, gang violence, and social media approached for this story expressed concern that Dataminr\u2019s surveillance services have carried racially prejudiced policing methods onto the internet. \u201cI thought there was enough info out there to tell people to not do this,\u201d Desmond Patton, a professor and researcher on gang violence and the web at Columbia University\u2019s School of Social Work, told The Intercept. Social media surveillance-based counter-gang efforts routinely miss any degree of nuance or private meaning, explained Patton, instead relying on the often racist presumption that \u201cif something looks a certain way it must mean something,\u201d an approach that attempts \u201cno contextual understanding of how emoji are used, how hashtags are used, [which] misses whole swaths of deep trauma and pain\u201d in policed communities.", "Babe Howell, a professor at CUNY School of Law and a criminal justice scholar, shared this concern over context-flattening Twitter surveillance and the lopsided assessment of who looks dangerous. \u201cMost adolescents experiment with different kinds of personalities,\u201d said Howell, explaining that using \u201cthe artistic expression, the musical expression, the posturing and bragging and representations of masculinities in marginalized communities\u201d as a proxy for possible criminality is far worse than useless. \u201cFor better or worse we have the right to bear arms, and using photos including images of weapons to collect information about people based on speech and associations just imposes one wrong on the next and two wrongs do not make a right.\u201d", "Howell said the potential damage caused by labeling someone a \u201cpossible gang member,\u201d whether in a formal database or not, is very real. Labeling someone as gang-affiliated leads to what Howell described as \u201ctwo systems of justice that are separate and unequal,\u201d because \u201cif someone is accused of being a gang member on the street they will be policed with heightened levels of tension, often resulting in excessive force. In the criminal justice system they\u2019ll be denied bail, speedy trial rights, typical due process rights, because they\u2019re seen as more of a threat. Gang allegations carry this level of prejudicial bad character evidence that would not normally be admissible.\u201d", "All of this reflects crises of American overpolicing that far predate computers, let alone Twitter. But systematized social media surveillance will only accelerate these inequities, said \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz, a lawyer and researcher at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cCommunities of color use social media in ways that are readily misunderstood by outsiders,\u201d explained D\u00edaz. \u201cPeople also digitally brand themselves in ways that can be disconnected from reality. Online puffery about gang affiliation can be done for a variety of reasons, from chasing notoriety to deterring real-world violence. For example, a person might take photos with a borrowed gun and later post them to social media over the course of a week to create a fake persona and intimidate rivals.\u201d Similarly fraught was Dataminr\u2019s practice of honing in on certain geographical areas: \u201cGeo-fencing around poor neighborhoods and communities of color only aggravates this potential by selectively looking for suspicious behavior in places they\u2019re least equipped to understand.\u201d", "Of course, both Twitter and Dataminr vehemently maintain that the service they offer \u2014 monitoring many different social networks simultaneously for any information that might be of interest to police, ", " \u2014 does not constitute surveillance, pointing to Twitter\u2019s strict prohibitions against surveillance by partners. \u201cFirst Alert does not provide any government customers with the ability to target, monitor or profile social media users, perform geospatial, link or network analysis, or conduct any form of surveillance,\u201d Dataminr wrote to The Intercept.", "But it\u2019s difficult to wrap one\u2019s head around these denials, given that Twitter\u2019s anti-surveillance policy reads like a dry, technical description of exactly what Datminr is said to have engaged in. Twitter\u2019s developer terms of service \u2014 which govern the use of the firehose \u2014 expressly prohibit using tweets for \u201cconducting or providing surveillance or gathering intelligence,\u201d and orders developers to \u201cNever derive or infer, or store derived or inferred, information about a Twitter user\u2019s \u2026 [a]lleged or actual commission of a crime.\u201d", "Twitter spokesperson Lindsay McCallum declined to answer any questions about Dataminr\u2019s surveillance practices, but stated \u201cTwitter prohibits the use of our developer services for surveillance purposes. Period.\u201d McCallum added that Twitter has \u201cdone extensive auditing of Dataminr\u2019s tools, including First Alert, and have not seen any evidence that they\u2019re in violation of our policies,\u201d but declined to discuss this audit on the record.", "\u201cTwitter\u2019s policy does not line up with its actions,\u201d according to D\u00edaz. \u201cDataminr is clearly using the Twitter API to conduct surveillance on behalf of police departments, and passing along what it finds in the form of \u2018news alerts.\u2019 This is a distinction without difference. Conducting searches of Twitter for leads about potential gang activity, much like its monitoring of Black Lives Matter protests, is surveillance. Having Dataminr analysts run searches and summarize their findings before passing it along to police doesn\u2019t change this reality.\u201d", "Dataminr\u2019s use of the Twitter firehose to infer gang affiliation is \u201ctotally terrifying,\u201d said Forrest Stuart, a sociologist and head of the Stanford Ethnography Lab, who explained that even for an academic specialist with a career of research and field work spent understanding the way communities express themselves on social media, grasping the intricacies of someone else\u2019s self-expression can be fraught. \u201cThere are neighborhoods that are less than a mile away from the neighborhoods where I have have intimate knowledge, where if I open up their Twitter accounts, I trust myself to get a pretty decent sense of what their hashtags and their phrases mean,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cBut I know that I am still inaccurate because I\u2019m not there in that community. So, if I am concerned, as a researcher who specializes in this stuff \u2026 then you can imagine my concern and hearing that police officers are using this.\u201d", "Stuart added that \u201cresearch has long shown that police officers really lack the kind of cultural competencies and knowledge that\u2019s required for understanding the kinds of behavioral and discursive practices, aesthetic practices, taken up by urban black and brown youth,\u201d but that \u201chere in this Dataminr example, you\u2019re not talking about cops, you\u2019re now talking about private individuals [who] lack the even basic knowledge that officers are coming from, some knowledge of criminal behavior or some knowledge of gang behavior.\u201d", "Stuart believes Twitter owes its over\u00a0100 million active users, at the very least, a warning that their tweets might become fodder for a semi-automated crime dragnet, explaining that he himself uses the Twitter firehose for his ethnographic research, but had to first consent to a substantial data usage agreement aimed at minimizing harm to the people whose tweets he might study \u2014 guidelines that Dataminr doesn\u2019t appear to have been held to. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t violate Twitter\u2019s conditions by letter, doesn\u2019t it violate them at least in the essence of what Twitter\u2019s trying to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cAren\u2019t the terms and conditions set up so that Twitter isn\u2019t leading to negative impacts or negative treatment of people? At minimum, if they\u2019re gonna continue feeding stuff to Dataminr and stuff to police, don\u2019t they have some kind of responsibility, at least an ethical obligation, to let [users] know that \u2018Hey, some of your information is going to cops\u2019?\u201d When asked whether Twitter would ever provide such a notice to users, spokesperson McCallum provided a link to ", " that makes no mention of police or law enforcement.", "Rep.

In the end, said Tahan, it was \u201cmostly the weather\u201d that put a stop to public demonstrations: \u201cOur roads are terrible, and they basically flood in the winter.\u201d By around February, in the face of inclement weather and the emerging coronavirus pandemic, the beleaguered demonstrators largely dispersed.", "At the time, Tahan and his co-conspirators had no idea that the issues they were protesting \u2014 the corruption, nepotism, and incompetence of the ruling elite \u2014 had also laid the groundwork for a soon-to-ignite deadly blast. Yet thousands of October Revolutionaries were left asking themselves where to go with their newly acquired political consciousness. \u201cWe crossed a threshold in October, as many people broke out of sectarian thinking and lost their fear of criticizing the government,\u201d said Harb. \u201cBut is that something that can be maintained, especially as people continue to suffer?\u201d", "That suffering soon deepened, as the political class botched the country\u2019s response to the pandemic, and the economy further unraveled. \u201cDaily life for people went completely to hell,\u201d said Khouri, \u201cand the government continued to do nothing.\u201d", "Quarantined in his apartment, Tahan felt his hope wane, along with the fading momentum of the monthslong protests.

They were looking for any kind of help they could get.\u201d He recalled a pervasive sense of hopelessness: \u201cOnce again, after we\u2019d already had all we could take, things got worse.\u201d", " with the blast, they worsened again \u2014 in unimaginable ways. After the explosion, Tahan responded reflexively, heading back to the streets. Like Chehab, Zantout, and the Al Makan crew, Tahan also knew \u201cnot to count on the government to take care of us.\u201d Networks established in the October Revolution sprung back to life, as WhatsApp groups and social media campaigns quickly coordinated efforts, rallied resources, and called out predatory NGOs. When protests erupted soon after, veterans like Tahan were joined by newcomers like Chehab and Zantout, who had mostly stayed home in October.", "The blast, compounding the suffering of 2019 and the coronavirus crisis, may have been a wakeup call for those who the October Revolution didn\u2019t reach. \u201cEach crisis has activated new people, but this blast shook something deeper. Now, people are asking questions they\u2019ve never asked before,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re questioning the very structure of the sectarian system, asking, \u2018Is this what we really want?\u2019 That\u2019s never happened before.\u201d It\u2019s also garnered much more involvement and support from the Lebanese diaspora than any past action, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to see how many Lebanese abroad, especially young people, suddenly want to be a part of shaping the country\u2019s future.\u201d", "How to shape that future remains open for debate. This time around, Tahan said, no one expects protests alone to suffice. \u201cWe stood in the streets for months and nothing changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, we changed people\u2019s minds, but we didn\u2019t change the government.\u201d Many, like Chehab and Zantout, have stopped going to protests, choosing instead to focus on grassroots work. Koleilat, who has become a regular volunteer with the group, attended an early protest, but said that, after witnessing the government\u2019s harsh response, she \u201clost hope\u201d in the demonstrations. \u201cIn the end, even though I love this country, and I believe in this cause, can I as a mother of three really put my life in danger, when I know it won\u2019t make a difference?\u201d", "The combination of delay tactics and violent crackdowns may prove enough to break the burgeoning resistance movement, said Khouri. \u201cThis is a population that has tasted a unified national vision and their determination is real, but it\u2019s not clear whether this can withstand all the challenges they face. This elite ruling class has been in power for\u00a030 years, and they not only have incredible networks of clients and allies, but they also have the guns.\u201d The Lebanese state has become \u201cincreasingly militarized\u201d in the face of repeated uprisings, Khouri added. Even as more Lebanese struggle to meet their daily needs, any impulse to protest must be weighed against the growing possibility of state violence. \u201cIt seems that things cannot go on this way much longer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then again, many of us felt that was true six months ago.\u201d", "The rising desperation could help build or undo the movement. For Geha, the co-founder of Khaddit Beirut, the fact that the Lebanese people have \u201cso little to lose\u201d opens up the possibility for bold new steps. \u201cSo many of us have no salaries, no health, nothing left,\u201d she said. \u201cThe very least we deserve is to allow ourselves to imagine a different way.\u201d", "In the more optimistic view, the blast and the organic grassroots efforts that followed can be seen as an acceleration in the development of such an \u201calternative vision.\u201d As people like Chehab, Zantout, and Khodr spontaneously respond to the crises around them, they demonstrate civil society\u2019s ability to bypass government stalemate and corruption.", "Yet the scale of the problems can be overwhelming. \u201cWe\u2019d start by fixing a window, and then the woman would say, \u2018Could I have some money to buy milk for my child? Could you help me get diapers?\u2019 Now, they\u2019re calling us asking for help with school supplies,\u201d Khodr said. As donations have slowed and some of their college-age volunteers have returned to class, Khodr said the group is currently assessing new strategies. Two months since the blast, they are unanimous about the need to shift to a more durable vision. So far, they\u2019ve expanded beyond food aid and cash assistance to more long-term projects like vocational training for women and mental health care for children.", "Geha said she and her colleagues have been grappling with similar issues, but the shift from dependency on NGOs and politicians to self-reliance is heartening. \u201cWe need to all realize that programs are reversible,\u201d she said, \u201cthat these manmade disasters can be changed. When we come together and ask these questions, we help each other open our minds.\u201d Other community-based organizations, such as ", " and ", ", have emerged to address large-scale issues such as equitable housing, a sector which was marred with corruption long before the blast.", "Others haven\u2019t given up on revolution.
